# Across Protocol DAO Formation Celebration


### Summary 
I got to learn about Across protocol a bit for this project.
I love the fact that they are transitioning to a DAO and giving the project to the people is so exciting.

For this design I tried to make something that would look cool and flashy since this will be given away at an end of year party.
I opted to not include UMA branding because I think it's Across Protocol's time to shine since this is basically the official inception of their DAO.
